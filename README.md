## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model for laptop prices. The dataset used consists of various attributes related to laptops, including:

- **Brand**: Laptop manufacturer
- **Processor type and speed**
- **RAM size**
- **Hard disk size**
- **Screen size**
- **Weight**
- **Operating system**
- **Ratings**

This information is processed and used to predict the laptop's price, providing valuable insights for consumers and vendors.
